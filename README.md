This project focuses on classifying tweets into positive and negative sentiments using machine learning and NLP techniques.

📂 Dataset
The dataset used is tweet_sentiment.csv, which contains labeled tweet data. It includes:

Tweets as raw text
Corresponding sentiment labels (e.g., positive, negative)
🚀 Algorithms Used
You can experiment with various models:

Naive Bayes
LSTM
BERT
(The current implementation seems to leave the model choice open—feel free to update once the final model is decided.)

📌 Tasks Performed
Downloading and loading the dataset
Data preprocessing (cleaning text, tokenization, etc.)
Feature extraction (like TF-IDF or embeddings)
Training ML model(s)
Evaluation with metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.
