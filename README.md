🧠 Sentiment Analysis on Tweets

Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis project! This notebook-based project demonstrates how to analyze and classify sentiments in tweets using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify tweets into positive or negative sentiments based on their textual content. This task is achieved by applying popular ML algorithms and NLP preprocessing techniques.

📂 Dataset

Name: tweet_sentiment.csv
Description: A CSV file containing tweets labeled with their sentiment.
Features:
tweet: The text of the tweet
sentiment: The label (e.g., positive or negative)
